Files in this package:
- app-release.aab (signed Android App Bundle) - path: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
- my-release-key.jks (keystore used to sign the bundle)
- keystore.properties (contains keystore file name and passwords)

Important:
1. Back up the keystore (my-release-key.jks) and password securely. Without it you cannot update the app in Play Console.
2. In Play Console, create an app and upload the AAB under the appropriate release track (internal/testing/production).
3. Consider enabling Google Play App Signing and follow Play Console prompts to upload your key if desired.
4. Do NOT commit the keystore or keystore.properties to source control. They are already added to .gitignore.

Keystore details:
- alias: energylinkkey
- storePassword: Energylink2026!
- keyPassword: Energylink2026!

If you want, I can create a zip for download with the aab and keystore, or help you upload to Play Console manually.
